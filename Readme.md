# Flutter Overview

Flutter is an open-source UI software development toolkit created by Google. It is used to develop cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase.

## Key Features

- **Fast Development:** Hot reload helps you quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bugs.
- **Expressive and Flexible UI:** Flutter’s layered architecture lets you control every pixel on the screen.
- **Native Performance:** Flutter’s widgets incorporate all critical platform differences such as scrolling, navigation, icons, and fonts.

3. Run `flutter doctor` to check your environment.
